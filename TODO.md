- training plots for triple resnet

- try f2 optimization on triple resnet output
- set up optimization of weights on triple resnet

- balance batch composition 
  - dictionary mapping classes to images having that class
  - sampler that requires all classes be represented in each batch

- replace inf-three color image set with R-inf-B
